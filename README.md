# CPU Monitor

A real-time CPU monitoring tool for Linux that displays per-core frequencies, temperatures, and detailed CPU information in a terminal interface.

## Features

- **Real-time monitoring**: Updates every second with current CPU data
- **Per-core frequencies**: Shows individual core frequencies in MHz
- **Temperature monitoring**: Displays temperatures from various sensors (CPU, GPU, NVMe, etc.)
- **Detailed CPU info**: Shows additional CPU specifications from `lscpu`
- **Terminal UI**: Clean, organized display using ncurses
- **Responsive**: Adapts to terminal size with proper bounds checking

## Requirements

- Linux operating system
- Python 3.x
- `lscpu` command available
- Access to `/proc/cpuinfo`, `/proc/stat` and `/sys/class/hwmon/`

## Installation

1. Clone or download the `cpu_monitor.py` file
2. Make it executable (optional):
   ```bash
   chmod +x cpu_monitor.py
   ```

## Usage

Run the monitor:
```bash
python3 cpu_monitor.py
```

Press `q` to quit the application.

\* Yes this system is thermally constrained (hence this project)

## Data Sources

- **CPU Info**: Retrieved from `lscpu` command
- **Per-core frequencies**: Read from `/proc/cpuinfo`
- **CPU utilization**: Read from `/proc/stat`
- **Temperatures**: Read from `/sys/class/hwmon/` sensors


## Supported Sensors

The tool automatically detects and displays data from various hardware monitoring sources:

### Available Sensor Types
- **Temperatures**: CPU, GPU, NVMe SSDs, network adapters, memory modules
- **Voltages**: GPU voltages (vddgfx, vddnb) and other voltage rails
- **Power**: GPU power consumption and other power sensors
- **Fan Speeds**: Detected when available through hwmon

### Fan Speed Detection Issues

**Common Issue on Newer Motherboards (ASRock X870, etc.):**

Fan sensors may not be detected because newer Super I/O chips (like Nuvoton NCT6798D) aren't fully supported in current kernels. If `sensors-detect` finds your chip but fan speeds don't appear, try:

```bash
# Manually load the driver module
sudo modprobe nct6775

# Check if fans now appear
sensors
```

**Note**: This workaround may only partially work until the driver is updated for your specific chip. Fan detection depends on:
- Kernel version and driver support
- Motherboard manufacturer implementation
- Super I/O chip compatibility

## Notes

- Requires root privileges on some systems to access certain temperature sensors
- Sensor availability depends on your hardware and kernel drivers
- The display adapts to terminal size - resize your terminal if content appears truncated
- Fan speeds require compatible hardware monitoring drivers
